      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Amina Deria but my children call me "The Tea Girl" as I drink far too many cups of tea a day than the average person. 
        I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time analysing things and fixing little details. Also I like working in a team as I learn faster and much more. As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
       I am currently a Support Worker at a Mental Health Hospital and also a carer for my 7yr old son. 
       I have always been in the healthcare sector and it is all I had known.  As my children are in full time education now, I felt the time had come for me to go back to full-time work. The idea of going back to healthcare did not sit very well with me as I wanted a change of career, something different, challenging and satisfying. After some research I came across coding, it felt right! I started teaching myself with the aid of books and online resources.

      <h2>Hobbies & Interest</h2>
      <p>
        In my spare time (which I don't get much of as a mum), I write little poems about my experiences in life and also set little challenges for myself. <br>
       As autistic myself, I am a big fan of supporting people with mental health or/and learning disability. <br> I spend a big part of my spare time at my local mosque to raise awareness of the importance of mental health, to discuss issues leading to the high rate of divorce among young muslim couples and other domestic issues.

      <h2>End Goal</h2>
      <p>By the end of this course, I hope to gain some confidence than I started with but most importantly, I would like to have achieved a good level of coding knowledge and skills to form a platform on which I could start building a new career.</p>
